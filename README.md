# EcoOracleChat
Streamlit app for the Eco Oracle Agent

Other parts of this solution:
* It is powered by Google Agent Builder agents, here is the agent export (with examples): https://github.com/MrCsabaToth/EcoOracleAgent
* A little glue code is needed in a form of Cloud Function to call into the Agent Builder agent via DialogFlow CX API, several versions here: https://github.com/gdgfresno/EcoAgentFunction
* This was also a part of a hackathon: https://devpost.com/software/eco-oracle
